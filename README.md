# fakejsonserver

Easy to use fake json server for quick CRUD endpoint. 
It provides CRUD endpoint for ToDo application. 

Technology used:  
Node.js  
Sqlite database  

Use nodemon if you want to make changes in server. It will keep track of file changes and restart server when any change is detected. 

To install dependencies  
`npm install`

To start server  

`cd node/bin`  

if nodmon installed  
    `nodemon www -w ../` 
    
if not
    `node wwww`  

We used '-w ../' in nodemon command so that it can watch parent directory which is root directory in our case. 

Enjoy your new server.  
Cheers.
